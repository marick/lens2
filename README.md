# Lens2

Descended from the Lens library, it hopes there can be lens interface that is so similar to the (say) `Map` interface that client code doesn't have to *care* where, within a nested structure, the data that has to change lives,  has a
ridiculous amount of documention, and wants to collect a good number of common idioms.
