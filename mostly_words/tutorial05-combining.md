# Sample pipelines

Most lenses are straightforward, and so are most pipelines of
lenses. But lenses can be combined in some fairly complicated ways by
using lens makers in `Lens2.Lenses.Combine`.


Here I want to call out a few that
operate on other lenses and show examples of how they're used with
`def_composed_maker`.
