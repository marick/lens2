defmodule Lens2.Makers do
  @moduledoc """
  Two ways of defining named lens-making functions that improve on `def`.

  *Lens makers* are named functions that, when called, return a
   lens. Lens makers are created in three ways:

  1. Using plain old `def`:

         def leaf(key), do: Lens.key(:down) |> Lens.key(key)

     This is fine, but you *cannot* use `leaf` itself in a pipeline. That is, this
     will fail to compile:

         Lens.key(:upper) |> leaf(:bottom)
         error: undefined function leaf/2

  1. Because of that, it's better to use `def_composed_maker/2` (alternately, `deflens/2`).
     This creates a lens maker from one or more other lens makers, most often
     by piping them into each other. For example, a lens maker for two-level maps
     could be defined like this:

         def_composed_maker leaf(key), do: Lens.key(:down) |> Lens.key(key)
         # Works fine:
         Lens.key(:upper) |> leaf(:bottom)

  1. `def_maker/2` (alternately, `defmaker/2` or `deflens_raw/2` is used for cases where
     a lens maker can't be made from other lens makers. For example, the definition of
     ``Lens2.Lenses.Keyed.key!/1`` looks like this:

         @spec key!(any) :: Lens2.lens
         def_maker key!(key) do
           fn composed, descender ->
             {gotten, updated} = descender.(DefOps.fetch!(composed, key))
             {[gotten], DefOps.put(composed, key, updated)}
           end
         end

  In both cases, there are actually *four* distinct functions defined,
  though the documentation only describes one. For the `leaf(key)`
  example above, those functions are:

  * `leaf(key)`: Takes a key and returns a lens. This is the documented version.

  * `leaf(lens, key)`: This composes the given lens with the one made
    from `leaf(key)`.  This is why you can build pipelines from lens
    makers (as in the definition of `leaf` itself).

  * tracing_leaf(key): Produces the same lens as `leaf(key)` except that, when the
    lens is used, it contributes to a trace of what a `Lens2.Deeply` function does:

       ![Alt-text is coming](pics/tracing_example.png)

  * `tracing_leaf(lens, key)`: the pipeline-friendly version of `tracing_leaf/1`.


  [[[[Move the following elsewhere.]]]

  ## Understanding the mechanism

  A lens function is of two forms. The first is a subtype of what `Access` calls type
  `Access.access_fun`. It is a function with this API:

      fn
        :get, container, getting_descender ->
          # returns a list with the gotten values.

        :get_and_update, container, getting_and_updating_descender ->
          # returns a tuple:
          #   { a list with the gotten values,
          #     an updated version of the original `data`.
          #   }
      end

  (It's a subtype because the gotten value must be a list, whereas `Access` functions
  can return `any` type, typically a leaf value rather than a list.)

  For this module, I'm going to call it a *composed* function because it's typically
  built from other lenses, like this:

      deflens keys(keys),
        do: keys |> Enum.map(&key/1) |> Lens.multiple

  or

      deflens clusters,
        do: Lens.key(:name_to_cluster) |> Lens.map_values

  Lenses can also be built by wrapping an `access_fun` around another
  type of function which I'll call a "raw" function (for backwards compatibility
  with code that uses [Lens 1](https://hexdocs.pm/lens/readme.html)).

  This is a function like this:

      fn container, descender ->
        # Returns a tuple
      end

  Instead of the caller choosing between one descender (used for
  `:get`, returns a single value) and another (used for
  `:get_and_update`, returns a two-value tuple), the single
  `descender` function always returns a two-value tuple.

  * For updating cases like `Deeply.put/2` or `Deeply.update/3`, it's
    the usual `{gotten, updated}` tuple (and the `gotten` value is just
    discarded).

  * In the `:get` case, there's no updating, so the tuple duplicates the
    `gotten` values, and the second one is ignored.

  The `deflens_raw` macro takes the code for such a function and
  produces a `def` that creates a legitimate (`Access.access_fun` or
  `Lens2.lens`) lens maker. It creates the pipeline and tracing versions, too.

  ## Tracing

  Tracing versions of a function are given the name of the lens function with `tracing_`
  prepended. They don't appear in documentation, but they're there.

  @doc """
  Write a lens maker without using other lens makers.

  The body of the function must return a two-argument function that takes a container
  and a "descender" function:

      @spec key!(any) :: Lens2.lens
      def_maker key!(key) do
        fn container, descender ->
          ...
        end
      end

  The job of the returned function is to take the container, take a
  value within it, and pass it to the descender:

      def_maker key(key) do
        fn container, descender ->
          ... = descender.(DefOps.fetch!(container, key))
          ...
        end
      end

  (`Defops.fetch!` calls `Map.fetch!/2` in the case of a map or
  `Access.fetch!/2` otherwise. I presume the map version of `fetch!`
  is more efficient than the `Access` version.)

  The result is a tuple:

  * If the original container was being operated on by
    `Lens2.Deeply.get_and_update/3` or `get_and_update_in/3`, the first
    element contains the "get" and the second is the "update".

  * If the operation was a put or an update, the same is done â€“ I
    guess you've got the value right there, so you might as well pass it along. The
    original operation will discards it.

  * If the operation is a get, the gotten value will be both values of the tuple.

  Your code doesn't have to worry about that: it can simply assume
  `get_and_update` is being used.

        fn container, descender ->
          {gotten, updated} = descender.(...)
          ...
        end
      end

  Your code has to bundle up the `gotten` and `updated` functions into
  a tuple of its own and return that:

       fn container, descender ->
         {gotten, updated} = descender.(DefOps.fetch!(container, key))
         {[gotten], DefOps.put(container, key, updated)}
       end

  The "updated" case involves putting the new value in place of the
  one that was extracted "on the way down". The "gotten" case is more
  subtle **and I haven't figured out how to explain it. This paragraph
  should link to a tutorial I haven't written yet.**
